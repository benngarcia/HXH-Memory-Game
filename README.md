Hunter X Hunter Inspired Memory Game for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/memory-card)

If anyone is looking at this for inspiration working on the same project, a few notes:

Don't look at my CSS files. This is my first time building a front-end, like ever. It is super scuffed and borderline disgusting. 

Logo was made in GIMP. 

I wouldn't take inspiration from my code design in general, I try not to look at others before I finish, and I've found it helps with the "toughest" part of these projects.
